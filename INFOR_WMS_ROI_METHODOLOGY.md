## 📝 **Calculation Formula Pattern**

For most categories:
```
Annual Benefit = (Number of FTEs × Cost per FTE) × Improvement %
```

For revenue-based:
```
Annual Benefit = (Annual Revenue × Operating Margin) × Revenue Increase %
```

For cost reduction:
```
Annual Benefit = Annual Cost × Reduction %
```
