I need to add these rows after the Total FTE cost row:

1. Section header: "Proportion of warehouse time per activity type:"
2. Activity inputs (7 rows):
   - Goods In: 18%
   - Put away: 7%
   - Replenishment: 8%
   - Pick: 42%
   - Loading: 10%
   - Stock Checking/PPI: 10%
   - Other: 5%
3. Total time allocation: 100%
4. Section header: "% Projected reduction:"
5. Reduction benchmarks (7 rows matching activities)
6. Total overall saving
7. Projected Savings (7 rows with calculations)
8. Expected annual benefits

Due to size, I'll need to update the JavaScript to handle these new calculations.
